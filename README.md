## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ryszard Hermanowicz. I am a systems thinker, systems engineer, and systems developer. I am a lifelong learner, ready for VUCA-world, serving as a leader, meticulous as a functional safety engineer, curious as a software engineer, and pragmatic as a coding craftsman. I enjoy tackling some of the biggest engineering challenges, growing my understanding of a system iteratively, constantly switching between big picture and tiny details, balancing between confidence in design decisions and modesty and respect to technology and its complexity.
